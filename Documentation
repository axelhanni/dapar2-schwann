  2. What is the purpose of your project? tell about ur project.
  The purpose for this project is for indecisive people to be able to make choices through this code which answers to yes/no questions.
  Not only does it accomodate a persons needs through answering yes/no questions but it can also somehow be able to help you have a concrete decision 
  made by yourself through the advisory comments given by the program. For example you want to ask the question of "Should I wear pink today?" 
  and the program will then reply with "Very doubtful.", as a result of that response you then decide to try other colors to see if they are any better.
  The use of this program has it's limits, questions asked should not be any serious questons that can possibly affect others or yourself in any negative way, due to the 
  responses that can be seemingly influential. Users must use the program responsibly.

  3. How does your program work? Explain how to run your code?
  To run the code the user shall input a yes/no question. Then the program will select a random response from the list of possible answers, it will then stimulate "thinking"
  with a short delay using time.sleep(). So it will now print an answer, and the program will continue running until the user types "quit".
